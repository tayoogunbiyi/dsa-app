            <li>Week 1's Topic is On Arrays & Strings</li>
            <li>You can read the text in chapter 1 of Cracking the coding interview (Pg 88)
                for an introduction to how arrays work under the hood
            </li>
            <li>
                Another good resource is this
                <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/arrays/1-d/tutorial/"
                    target="_blank">link</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Understand the difference between Arraylists ( AKA resizable arrays or dynamic arrays or lists) and
                Arrays.

            </li>
            <li>
                Good practice also involves attempting to write a resizable array from scratch.
            </li>
            <li>
                This might be counter productive in many such as Javascript and Python as they already
                provide this functionality out of the box. But regardless, it's good practice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bonus points if you attempt this implementation
                in C++ or Java , or basically any language that doesn't have their arrays as resizable
            </li>
            <li>
                Question Of The Week - Why are arrays able to give us constant time access (O(1) i.e really really fast)
                to
                elements,unlike other data structures ?
